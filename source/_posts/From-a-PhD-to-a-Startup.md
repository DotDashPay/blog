Howdy. My name is Sean Arietta and I am one of the co-founders and the CEO of [DotDashPay](http://dotdashpay.com). Before I co-founded DotDashPay with Colorado Reed and Joey Mucha, I was a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Computer Science. 

I worked on my PhD for 7 years and spent about 2.5 years before that doing undergraduate research. A decade of research… phew!

# What Does a PhD Student Do?

Over that decade, the single most common comment I received when I told someone that I was a PhD student in Computer Science was, “Oh, so you’re like a crazy good programmer, right?” As it turns out, I am a decent programmer, but that has very little do with being a PhD student. In fact, there are plenty of PhD students who are pretty awful programmers, although that is certainly not always the case.

A PhD student is a researcher. Student is probably not even an appropriate term, because they are typically paid for what they do. Do they learn? Of course, but everyone learns at their job right? Many people even take courses where they work. 

A PhD student’s primary objective is to conduct and publish research. I often call publications the currency of a researcher, with one catch. A single publication does not equate to a single unit of currency. The amount of currency one gets from a publication is related to the quality and impact of the publication.

# How to Be a Researcher

Operationally, conducting and publishing research takes the form of the following process:

1. Read a bunch of published work in a field
2. Think of something you can do that is both new (not like anything you’ve read) and novel (useful to someone other than you)
3. Do the least amount of work possible to show that you can do what you thought you could do
4. Analyze the results of (3) and iterate until you have thoroughly convinced yourself and your colleagues that you can do it
5. Run a bunch of rigorous tests that “prove” (4) and write up the results in a paper

This is not an easy process. It takes a lot of practice to make it efficient and a lot of creativity to make it inspiring. I was not a great researcher; I was a good one, but not great. The reason I wasn’t great is because of two things:

1. I found step (4) to be laborious and unrewarding
2. After step (5) I never felt I had truly contributed something great

It’s important to note this, because it turns out that starting a company is **very** similar to doing research, except that I get a lot of satisfaction out of the analogous step (4) and post (5) in business. 

# Business ~= Research

-*Those of you who are MATLAB programmers, please note that I am using ~= to mean almost equal :).*

Starting a business and being a researcher have a lot of similarities. The currency is different, and the actual day-to-day tasks to accomplish the goals of each are different, but if you squint your eyes a bit they start to look the same. Here’s an analogous list of tasks when starting a business or project within a business:

1. Figure out what kinds of companies already exist in the space
2. Find a new sliver of the market that is currently not being served or is under-served
3. Do the least amount of work possible to show that you can generate money from that sliver
4. Analyze the results of (3) and iterate until you get enough customers / traction that you can raise money / be sustainable / etc.
5. Profit

You can see the pattern here right? The fundamental differences are in how you evaluate success, what you optimize for (the currency), and that last step (5). 

### Evaluating Success

In research and in startups you evaluate success in terms of how much currency you’ve earned. Currency in research is (# of publications) x (quality and impact). Currency in startups is measured in… well it depends on your startup. Some startups value investment money, although this is generally considered a bad idea. YC argues that the currency of a startup is [growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html). 

Personally, I think it depends on the stage you’re in. Sometimes you **need** money or the lights will turn off. But generally speaking, I think YC has the right of it, and I don’t really have the experience to say otherwise at the moment.

### Profit vs. Publish

Step (5) of the two lists above are markedly different. On the research side we have to actually write out our results and try to get someone to publish them. For a business or a startup, generally you don’t have to do that. If you corner the market or raise the money you desire then you’ve already won. There is no conference or journal you need to prove that to. You’ve already proved your idea to everyone that matters. Pat yourself on the back and have a beer… and then start the process over :).

# The Grand Conclusion

Ok, here it is. If you’re a PhD student and you love + are good at the first 3 things on the list, but dislike very much the process of publishing and find the “proving” aspects of it to be less than wonderful, then you should start a business instead. 

I say this because being good at 1-3 seems to be very transmutable. I don’t have a lot of data personally, but I know a lot of people who have made this leap and it does seem to be the case. That is anecdotal evidence, so if you are a good researcher you won’t believe me. 

What really matters is what gets you fired up and creates that rush inside that is addicting. I’ll soften my statement a bit by saying if that rush comes from building things and having other people see them and you don’t care so much about proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you did was correct, then at least give it a shot. And know that you’re time in academia has not be a waste. You just need to shift a couple things around to be effective.

### Nota Bene

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on who you are), having any aptitude as a PhD student is neither necessary nor sufficient to be a good entreprenuer. My own experience tells me that being good at 1-3 makes you better at finding good problems to work on and makes you efficient in finding solutions to those problems, but starting a company requires a lot more than just that. There are countless examples of extremely successful entrepreneurs who don't have PhDs, or even finished college for that matter. 

In the end, I think that being good at 1-3 just decreases your risk of failure. By what amount you ask? That's for a researcher to analyze.
